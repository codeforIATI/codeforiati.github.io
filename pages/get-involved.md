### Adding a tool to Code for IATI

We are keen to [list additional tools on the Code for IATI site](https://codeforiati.org/) (or host them on the [Code for IATI Github organisation](https://github.com/codeforiati) if requested) as long as they are:
* open source;
* somehow related to IATI data (even loosely);
* include contributor guidelines;
* make clear who is responsible for maintaining the software, whether volunteers, a company, or the IATI Secretariat via official support.

If your project meets these criteria, please send a _Pull Request_ adding a new file for your project [in this folder](https://github.com/codeforIATI/codeforiati.github.io/tree/master/_projects). (If you're not sure how to do this, get in touch!)

(note, we also have a [Code of Conduct](https://codeforiati.org/code-of-conduct))
